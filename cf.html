            <h2>1. Kinds of Problems in Nature (Iteration, Recursion, Backtracking)</h2>
            <p>There are different approaches to solving problems in nature:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Iteration</strong>: Repeated execution of a set of instructions. Example: Calculating sums, traversing through lists.</li>
                <li><strong>Recursion</strong>: Breaking down a problem into smaller sub-problems. Example: Fibonacci series, Tree traversal.</li>
                <li><strong>Backtracking</strong>: Exploring all possible solutions and backtracking when an incorrect solution is found. Example: N-Queens problem, Sudoku solver.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Time Efficiency</strong>: The amount of time an algorithm takes to solve a problem, often expressed using Big-O notation (e.g., O(n), O(log n)).</li>
                <li><strong>Space Efficiency</strong>: The amount of memory used by an algorithm, also expressed in terms of Big-O notation.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Divide and Conquer</strong>: Break the problem into smaller sub-problems, solve them, and combine the results. Example: Merge Sort.</li>
                <li><strong>Greedy Algorithms</strong>: Make the locally optimal choice at each step. Example: Activity selection problem.</li>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Programming</strong>: Solve subproblems and store their results to avoid redundant calculations. Example: Fibonacci, Knapsack problem.</li>
                <li><strong>Brute Force</strong>: Try all possible solutions, often leading to inefficient solutions. Example: Checking all combinations in a puzzle.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Binary Tree</strong>: Each node has at most two children.</li>
                <li><strong>Binary Search Tree (BST)</strong>: A binary tree where the left child is smaller and the right child is larger.</li>
                <li><strong>AVL Tree</strong>: A self-balancing BST that maintains balance during insertions and deletions.</li>
                <li><strong>Red-Black Tree</strong>: A balanced tree that ensures no path from root to leaf is more than twice as long as any other.</li>
                <li><strong>Trie</strong>: A tree-like data structure used to store strings, optimizing search operations in dictionaries or routing tables.</li>
